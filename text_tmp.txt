and the standing man was actively deploring the coiled humble state of his nation and the present was merely an endless attempt to evade the trophied glories of the past and this his russia had been majestic and mythical once and even the variegated oddities and fairy tale deformities of their elders stood for will and character , for something humanly achieved , in comparison with the obsessive , pathic health of modern russians , infantilism raised to the norm and holified , the cuntry baptised in translucent streams of pure weakness , and the entire system was whipped into undead locomotion by sleepless bureaucrats with false benevolence and empty liberty tattooed onto their tongues , and the bureaucrat , however , was tolerant , that ravenous predator , his acceptance of the administered people as they are only stemmed from his hatred of what they might be , a powerful nation swift in its purity and merciless in its life appetite , their impolite hunger , and the raging potencies of ancient russia , the fatal equanimity of the nomadic slavs bred with the screaming blood and clean iron of their warlike children , a power that had been slipped into catatonic obsolescence by the comfortable lies of the chinovnik state and the peaceful requirements of modern life and coexistence such an absurd notion was inimical to the russian heart for theirs was the vehicle , the hardened sacred vehicle , the chariot of affirmation , the machine of absolution , and which driver is not tempted , merely by all the power of his engine , to wipe out the vermin of the street , pedestrians , children and cyclist pederasts , the rationalistic impurities of the new continent , now so old , its vision blinded by all the godless illuminations of centuries past , and this was spreading , other peoples were falling , such diseases recognized no borders , even in the forests of russia for many men it is already an impertinence to say i , no sacred i granted in safeguard by god and ancestral right , for cherish and worship , only microbial manifestations and hypostases of goddess reason , the individual a guise of the total , united under the social blanket to further progress and spread their sterile light , and this was to move forward and bring prosperity and advances and mendacious liberty and social health but in this all the movements of health resembled the reflex movements of beings whose hearts have stopped beating and russia could not exist without its hearts one could not take away the mujiks heart and offer him a clean new brain in return , such was not the path , no not the desire of the land and its god , and to-days youth refused to think in the old tongue and would not look at any issue but in the whole and assault the problems fearlessly , frontally , and do away with the whole of the problem , but the whole was the false , and the thinkers and the travellers sought to draw russia under the emblem of the whole , to render all its magics and stories thinkable and fully knowable and free in form , desiccate them into single-faceted trifles , and charting flourished systems of connection and similarity and everything was to become thinkable under the same terms and tools , but to perceive resemblances everywhere , making everything alike , is a sign of weak eyesight , the blindness that was eternal sister to illumination , but this was suicide and the impotent rust of such fallow minds would be razored off by the sharp laugh of any holy fool , but this was the weak-minded protest of minds that could not contend with the plurality of greatness , the unthinkableness of transcendent power , and russia was allowing its power to hibernate in distant caves while the greatest and most vulnerable sicle unfolded and thought itself to death mere minutes away , all the mother cuntry need do was rouse itself from the torpor of logicked knowledge and take it , take the century , teach corrupted impuissant reason and its withered little men the purity of will the sacred rightness of timeous plenteous victory but alas russia did not have ears for him and the standing man stood alone while others sat down to western plays in westernised theatres or in western homes to read western newspapers and ruminate western thoughts , and that which to him was most wonderful , eyes on his eyes , russian eyes on his russian eyes , russian ears on his russian words , these were not to be found , the hypnotised masses were beaten into wasting soporation by the fata morgana of comfort and complacency , the people had been tricked by the wails of liberty into stopping atop one single point in history and resting there and as its rest extended for the head lacked the will to bid the body stand once more the sands of history grew to like the resting peoples form and kissed it and came to rest on the people and the sands swallowed more and more of the people and if the will did not expurgate the cowardly instinct for rest from the story of the people , russia itself would soon become merely another sand hill in historys desert futile and forgotten but the will to move would not let itself be roused by the screams of the standing man and he had been fighting his cuntrys morbid stasis for years and would drown out this corruption like a rat in russian blood if need be but so far the standing man was merely rediscovering in revolution all the platitudes of conformism and few would listen and when the standing man spoke up where more could hear the bureaucratic response was impeccable in expedition but it was all a diverting game for them for the standing man was only taken in sufficient seriousness to be warehoused in jail from time to time and allowed to marinate in the prickly frustrations of his own unmated fervour and such was the reach of the intellectuals and the semitic elements and the office dwellers and the lesser bloods such as the merchant poles or the trickster armenians whose vegetal interests were well watered by russias lapse into irrelevance and namelessness and were but a few men of worth and heart to lend him the standing man their soulwindows and let in let inside the spring of his voice the parasitic elements and the rationalists and the profiteers and the nihilists and the liberals would all be erased from the history of russia and her greatness in the plenitude of its dulcet irrefragability would be written in their blood on white walls , their wasted brains would paint russias visceral triumph against the white walls and the borderless maps of russias supernal hereafter .
