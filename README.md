WordNet word sense disambiguation and ontology creation

Understanding Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a big puzzle in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While there are different tools available, like the Lesk algorithm in the NLTK library, they don't always give the most accurate results. On the other hand, deep neural networks can be more accurate, but they need a lot of memory, which can be tricky. There we introduce a new way to tackle WSD problems. It helps save memory while still keeping accuracy high. The method we present here makes it easy to use WSD in NLP tasks, just like you'd use the NLTK library.
